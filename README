This is still work in progress.

Unfortunatelly the site handhelds.org is now down, so most of the available information has vanished. There seems to be ftp mirrors hosting the information.

What's needed

1. An iPAQ H36xx, H37xx or H38xx.
2. Either a jacket with CF reader or a craddle with serial port cable (prefered)
3. A craddle/cable with USB connector.
4. Install linux on your handheld.

Warning
-I take no responsability if your iPAQ get bricked.
-There is no dual boot capability, although it is posible to reinstall WindowsCE

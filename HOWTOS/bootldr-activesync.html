	<em><p>
	Please note that this manual does not cover the HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and H6300
	series of devices yet.
	<p>Please <b>do not</b> even try to apply the existing instructions from the 
	installation guide on any of the  HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and H6300
	series of devices. The installation will fail and in a worst case you may
	<b>end up with a bricked device</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>We hope to be able to rectify the documentation situation shortly and
	appologize for the delay.

<ul>
<li>Transfer BootBlaster and bootldr to your iPAQ using ActiveSync.
<ol>
<li><p>If ActiveSync isn't already installed on your Windows PC,
install it by inserting the iPAQ Pocket PC Companion CD-ROM into the PC's
drive and following the ensuing instructions.</p>

<li><p>Copy the BootBlaster and bootldr files that came with your Familiar
Linux distribution to your Windows PC if they're not already there.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you're installing on an H3900 iPAQ, the files are named
<?echo $FAMILIAR_BB3900?> and <?echo $FAMILIAR_BL3900?>.</p>
<li><p>Otherwise, they're named <?echo $FAMILIAR_BB?> and
<?echo $FAMILIAR_BL?>.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Plug the iPAQ cradle into an AC power outlet.</p>

<li><p>Connect the USB connector from the cradle to the Windows PC.</p>

<li><p>Slide the iPAQ into its cradle.  If a "Set Up a Partnership" screen
appears on the PC, choose "No" and then click Next.</p>

<li><p>Copy <?echo $FAMILIAR_BB?> or <?echo
$FAMILIAR_BB3900?> to the default folder on the iPAQ by clicking Explore
in ActiveSync and dragging their icons there.  Ignore any "may need to
convert" messages.</p>

<li><p>Do the same thing for <?echo $FAMILIAR_BL?> or
<?echo $FAMILIAR_BL3900?>.</p>
</ol>

<li><p>Start BootBlaster.
<ol>
<li><p>Select "<code>Start -> Programs</code>" on the iPAQ touchscreen.</p>
<li><p>Tap on File Explorer.</p>
<li><p>Tap on BootBlaster.</p>
</ol>

<? include 'bootblaster-save.inc' ?>

<li>Copy saved_bootldr.gz and wince_image.gz to your Windows PC.
<ol>
<li><p>Select "<code>View -> Refresh</code>" in the ActiveSync Explore window
on the PC.  Icons for the saved_bootldr.gz and wince_image.gz files should
appear.</p>

<li><p>Drag the saved_bootldr.gz and wince_image.gz icons from the ActiveSync
Explore window to a local folder on your PC.</p>
</ol>

<p>
As with any backup files, please store saved_bootldr.gz and wince_image.gz in
a safe place.  We highly recommend verifying the built-in gzip checksum in
both files before presuming your backup is safe (see the gzip man page for
details).</p>

<? include "bootblaster-flash.inc" ?>

Continue to the <a href="install-serial.html">install serial</a> step.</p>

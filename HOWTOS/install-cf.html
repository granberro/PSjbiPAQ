<h2>Bootloader GUI (h3600, h3700, h3800 and h3900)</h2>
	<ol>
      <li> 
	Copy <code>reflash.ctl</code>, <code>md5sums</code> and the
	appropriate <code>jffs2</code> files to the root directory of
	the CF card.  The CF card should have a vfat filesystem. Almost all cards
	come pre-formatted with a vfat filesystem.
      </li>
      <li>
      Insert the CF card into the iPAQ.  (If you are using a dual-CF sleeve,
      the card must be in the first slot.)
      </li>
      <li>
      Hold down the joypad and push the reset button on the iPAQ.  You will need
      to remove it from the cradle to access the reset button.
      </li>
      <li>
	When the bootloader splash screen appears, release the joypad.
	         <br><img src="bootldr-splash.png"><br>
      </li>
      <li>
	Check the version number on the splash screen.  If it is lower
	than 2.21.12, or there is no version number at all, you should
	<a href="upgrade-bootldr.html">upgrade the bootloader</a> before proceeding.
      </li>
      <li>
	Push the record button on the side of the iPAQ.  After a short
	pause, you will be offered a menu of images and invited to
	select one.  Move the highlight using the joypad, then press
	the centre of the joypad to select the desired item.
      </li>
      <li>
	Press the record button again when prompted to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
	Wait patiently.  The flashing process will take a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
	When installation is complete, reset the machine by pressing
	the action button (centre of the joypad) again.
      </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Bootloader console (h5400, h5500)</h2>

<p>As the bootloader doesn't currently support the screen on the h5400/h5500,
you will need to use the serial console to flash your iPAQ from CF. Connect to the bootldr
serial console as described in the <a href="install-serial.html">serial installation instructions</a>, 
but instead of <code>load root</code>, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<LI>Insert your CF card</LI>
	<li>Load the jffs2 image into the root by entering the following bootloader command (replacing <code><i>filename.jffs2</i></code> with the name of the jffs2 image file on the card):
<pre>
copy hda1:<i>filename.jffs2</i> root
</pre>
</li>
<li>Boot it:</li>
<pre>
boot
</pre>
</ol>

<hr>
		
    <p>When finished continue to the <a href="post-install.html">post-install</a> step.

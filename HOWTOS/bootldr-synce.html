    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    SynCE transfers between Linux and Microsoft Pocket PC using the same protocol that "ActiveSync" uses.
    </p>
    <p>SynCE is quite new and evolving rapidly, and its use for installing Linux on the iPAQ is 
    also new, so it is quite possible you will have difficulties given its early state and rapid
    evolution. The directions below were written using SynCE version 0.7. Using
    SynCE does spare you from having to have a Windows system to
    install Linux on your iPAQ. </p>
    <p>
    If you have difficulties, you can always use the <a href="bootldr-activesync.html">ActiveSync method</a> 
    of bootloader installation.

    <h2>Bootldr Installation and Backup</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First: install <a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/">SynCE</a>.
    <p>
    <li>Plug in your serial cable from your system to the iPAQ, and make sure the
    iPAQ is plugged into its power-supply.  You don't want your iPAQ to run out of power in the middle
    of this procedure.
    <p>
    <li>Startup SynCE:
     Start the SynCE communications daemon and configure your serial port on your
     Linux system by executing the following commands, which start up SynCE, configure
     your serial port, and start up a PPP connection to the iPAQ.  Some of the commands
     must be executed as root, and some must not be executed as root: the commands that
     must be exectuted as root are indicated by use of the "sudo" command below.
     <ul>
     <p>
     <code>dccm</code>
     <br>
     <code>sudo synce-serial-config ttyS0</code>
     <br>
     <code>sudo synce-serial-start</code>
     </ul>
     <p>
    If all is well, you'll get cheery connect tones from your iPAQ, and ppp0 will
    be alive and well on your Linux system, and the iPAQ can be pinged using 
    the address shown by your ifconfig ppp0 information.</p>
    <li> Two programs have to be copied to the iPAQ: 
         a program "BootBlaster" that is used to rewrite the 
         boot sector in flash with a bootloader "bootldr" able to support Linux (and PocketPC).
	 <p>
	 For H3100, H3600, H3700 and H3800 machines, the flash rewriter is named
	 <code>BootBlaster_1.18.exe</code>. 
	 <br>For H3900, H5400, and H5500 machines, it is named
	 <code>BootBlaster3900-2.3.exe</code>.
	 <p>
	 For H3100, H3600, H3700 and H3800 machines, the boot loader is named
	 <code><?echo $FAMILIAR_BL?>.gz</code>.
	 <br> For H3900, H5400, and H5500 machines, it is named
	 <code><?echo $FAMILIAR_BL3900?>.gz</code>.</p>
	 Bootblaster will take either gzipped or not-gzipped bootloader images; best to
	 use the supplied .gz format files.
	 <p>
	 The following SynCE commands will do the copy of these files
	 for all but the H3900:
	 <p>
	 <ul>
		 <code>pcp <?echo $FAMILIAR_BL?>.gz ":/My Documents/bootldr.bin.gz"</code>
	 <br>
	 <code>pcp BootBlaster_1.18.exe ":/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Bootblaster.exe"</code>
	 </ul>
	 <p>For the H3900, the commands are:
	 <p>
	 <ul>
		 <code>pcp <?echo $FAMILIAR_BL3900?>.gz ":/My Documents/bootldr.bin.gz"</code>
	 <br>
	 <code>pcp <?echo $FAMILIAR_BB?> ":/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Bootblaster.exe"</code
	 </ul>
	 <p>
	 <a name="runbootldr"></a>
     <li>Start up BootBlaster
     <p> From Pocket PC: "<code>Start->Programs-Bootblaster</code>", or from
     Linux, by the command:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <code>prun "/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Bootblaster.exe"</code>
     </ul>
     </p>

     <? include 'bootblaster-save.inc' ?>
     <li>Copy these files back to your Linux system by executing the following commands:
    <p>
    <ul>
    <code>pcp ":/My Documents/saved_bootldr.gz"</code>
    <br>
    <code>pcp ":/My Documents/wince_image.gz"</code>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Copying the bootldr file takes about 10 seconds over a serial line.
    As the Pocket PC image is pretty large, and serial lines slow, the copy of Pocket PC takes quite a while
    over a serial line (~20 minutes).
    <p>
    As in any backup files, please save them in a safe place.
    We save them in .gz form, both to speed copying them to the host, but more imporantly,
    to allows you to check whether the files have
    been correctly copied due to the internal checksum.  We highly recommend checking
    the checksum on both files before presuming your backup is safe (see the gzip man
    page for details).

    <? include "bootblaster-flash.inc" ?>

    <p>
    Shut down SynCE, "<code>killall dccm</code>", and
    continue to the <a href="install-serial.html">install serial</a> step. </p>
</ol>

	<em><p>
	Please note that this manual does not cover the HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and H6300
	series of devices yet.
	<p>Please <b>do not</b> even try to apply the existing instructions from the 
	installation guide on any of the  HP iPAQ H2200, Hx4700, and H6300
	series of devices. The installation will fail and in a worst case you may
	<b>end up with a bricked device</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>We hope to be able to rectify the documentation situation shortly and
	appologize for the delay.
	</p></em>

<p>Note that bootldr itself only supports CF.  So, while you can install
bootldr from Pocket PC using an MMC or SD card, you can only install Linux
if you have a CF card.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Copy the distribution files (all of them) to a CF card with a
	vfat filesystem (most cards come pre-formatted with vfat), or
	purchase a 32MB CF card with the distribution files from
	<a href="http://crynwr.com/cf/">Crynwr Software</a>.
	<li>Insert the CF card into your CF slot.
	<li>Run Start Menu-&gt;Programs-&gt;File Explorer.
	<li>Click on the grey bar with the picture of the iPAQ on it.
	It probably says "My Documents".
	<li>Select "My Device" from the drop-down menu.
	<li>One of the entries on the screen should say "Storage Card".  Click on it.
	<li>You should see a listing of the distribution files.
	<li>Double-click on BootBlaster.
	<li>BootBlaster will start up and display "Idle...".

	<? include 'bootblaster-save.inc' ?>
	<li>Copy saved_bootldr.gz, wince_image.gz and assets.gz from "My Documents" to the Storage Card using File Manager.
	<? include "bootblaster-flash.inc" ?>
</ul>

<p>When finished continue to the <a href="install-cf.html">Install via Compact Flash sleeve  </a> step.

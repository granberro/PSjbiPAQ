    <p>
      <em>
         H51xx, H54xx, H55xx: The bootldr does not support the display
         or CF/PCMCIA, so the root images must be <a
		 href="install-serial.html">installed
         via serial port.</a>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    There is experimental support for iPAQ <a href="http://handhelds.org/projects/h2200">H2200</a>,

    <p>
      <em>
         Note that, unfortunately, the Familiar installation manual does not yet cover
         these devices. If you have followed the corresponding ports projects and are familiar with the
         installation procedures, you are encouraged to try this release candidate. Otherwise
         you are recommended to wait for the final v0.8.4 release which will be accompanied by
         the required documentation.
      </em>
